## This repo is using some advanced data structures like HashSet and TreeSet from the Java Collections Framework(JCF)

This code will allow you to read a plain text document from their computer and it will check every word in the document against a dictionary. 
It will also generate suggestions for the words deems incorrect or missing from the dictionary. 

Sets in general do not allow any duplicated values.

HashSet and TreeSet: Classes that implements the Set interface and by extension, the Collection interface. 

HashSet:  HashSet will not guarantee the insertion order (unordered). Because of this, its more efficient than the TreeSet.

TreeSet: TreeSet always guarantee the insertion order. Unlike the HashSet, it will return a sorted collection.
